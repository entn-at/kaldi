// What we are implementing is an extension of CTC that we're calling

// language model on phones.
//
// This header implements a language-model class that's suitable for this
// phone-level model.  The implementation is efficient for the case where
// the number of symbols is quite small, e.g. not more than a few hundred,
// so tabulating probabilities makes sense.
// We don't put too much effort in making this the best possible language
// model and adding bells and whistles.
// We're implementing the count cutoffs in the way that we feel makes the
// most sense; it probably won't exactly match the way it's done in, say,
// SRILM.  And the way the discounting is done is also not quite the same
// it's done in the original Kneser-Ney publication, as we do it using
// continuous rather discrete counts; and we fix the constants rather
// than estimating them.
// this is Kneser-Ney "with addition" instead of backoff (see A Bit of Progress

/**
   This LanguageModel class implements a slight variant of a Kneser-Ney smoothed
   language model "with addition" (i.e. we add the backoff prob to the direct
   prob; in "A Bit of Progress in Language Modeling" this was found to be better).
   The variation is that do it with continuous counts instead of counts-of-counts,
   so instead of incrementing a count-of-counts for the lower order, we add the
   discounted amount, so we always deal with "real counts" (albeit the counts are
   fractional).  Because this makes the method of estimating the discounting
   constants impractical, we just use fixed values for them.  [Also, the Kneser-Ney
   discounting process is extended to the zero-gram case, which we define as
   distributing the probability mass equally to all vocabulary items; we assume
   the vocab size is known in advance.].  We use index 0 for both BOS and EOS;
   since they can never validly appear in the same context, this leads to no
   confusion and actually simplifies the code as we don't have to test for
   symbols appearing where they are disallowed.

   This language model (like the ARPA format) ensures that if "a b c" is a valid
   history-state, then "a b -> c" must exist as an n-gram (hence "a b" must be a
   valid history-state).  This ends up mattering in the CTC code.
