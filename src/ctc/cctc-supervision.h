// What we are implementing here is some things relating to computation of the
// CTC objective function.  The normal information required to compute the
// objective function is the reference phone sequence, and the computation is a
// forward-backward computation.  We plan to make possible both forward-backward
// and Viterbi versions of this.  However, we want to be able to train on parts
// of utterances e.g. a few seconds, instead of whole utterances.  For this we
// need a sensible way of splitting utterances, and for this we need the time
// information (obtained from a baseline system or from another CTC system).
// The framework for using the time information is that we will limit, in the
// forward-backward or Viterbi, each instance of a phone to be within the
// reference interval of the phone, extended by a provided left and right
// margin.  (this is something that Andrew Senior et al. did to reduce latency,
// in a paper they published).  This leads to a natural way to split utterances.
